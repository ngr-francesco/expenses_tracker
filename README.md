# expenses_tracker
**Basic idea:** open source expenses tracker application

**Objective:** Multiple ways of calculating balances (equally,unequally, based on some custom parameter, ...), multiple types of lists (eg. balances update recurrently, shopping lists, memo lists for expenses to keep track of, ...).

**Current stage:** Developing the backend. Frontend will be ReactNative, but for now only the basic framework is there, no actual functionality is implemented.

**Release goal:** Ideally within the first quarter of 2024 at least in beta.
